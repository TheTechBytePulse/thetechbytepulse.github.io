## About Me

Hello! I'm Prateep Gedupudi, a passionate technologist and Senior Cloud Computing Architect at Boeing. With a strong foundation in software engineering and a keen interest in AI/ML, I thrive on designing and building scalable, resilient, and high-quality systems.

### My Professional Journey

My career has been a rewarding journey through various facets of software development and architecture.

At **Boeing**, I've had the opportunity to work on critical projects, from enhancing the security of the MyBoeingFleet suite during its migration to Azure Cloud to championing a DevSecOps culture. I've led the transformation of on-premise services to the cloud and helped set new standards for automation and quality. Before my current role, I worked as an IT Systems and Data Analyst, where I developed solutions for flight testing systems, email processing, and even factory automation for painting robots using machine learning.

Before Boeing, I was a Senior Software Engineer at **CGI**, where I spent several years innovating on Trade360, a global trade and supply chain finance solution. There, I worked on everything from modernizing the UI with Dojo Toolkit to implementing RESTful services and even exploring blockchain with a POC on Ripple.

My earlier roles at **Marlabs Inc** and **Bilvac Techno Management Pvt Ltd** helped build the foundation of my career, where I honed my skills in Java, Spring, Hibernate, and various web technologies.

### My Philosophy

I believe in the power of data-driven solutions and continuous innovation. Whether it's architecting a complex cloud system or exploring the potential of a new technology, my goal is always to deliver successful products with efficiency and a forward-thinking approach.

This blog is my space to share my experiences, explore the pulse of technology, and connect with others who are just as excited about the future of tech as I am.

Thank you for stopping by!
