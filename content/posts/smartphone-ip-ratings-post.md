# Smartphone IP Ratings: Water and Dust Resistance Explained
This briefing reviews the concept of IP ratings in smartphones, a global standard that indicates a device's resistance to solid particles (like dust) and liquids (like water). Understanding IP ratings is crucial for consumers seeking durable devices that can withstand accidental exposure to environmental elements.

### 1\. What is an IP Rating?

*   **Definition:** "IP stands for Ingress Protection, and itâ€™s a global standard."
    
*   **Purpose:** The rating "defines that the smartphone is protected against dust and liquid spillage or water submersion (up to a certain level)."
    
*   **Format:** The rating is presented as "IP followed by two digits, like IP67, IP68, IP69 and so on."
    
*   **First Digit (0-6):** "refers to the protection from solid particles like dust." A higher number indicates better dust protection.
    
*   **Second Digit (0-9):** "refers to protection from liquids like water, edible liquids and more." A higher number indicates better liquid protection.
    
*   **General Rule:** "One must note that the higher the number of IPs, the better it is for device protection."
    

### 2\. Common IP Ratings and Their Meaning:

The source highlights three common IP ratings found in contemporary smartphones:

*   **IP67:** "Protected from dust and immersion in water by up to 1 meter for 30 minutes."
    
*   **IP68:** "It offers better protection, which is safe up to 1.5 meters of water and could safeguard the device for 30 minutes."
    
*   **IP69:** "This is the highest rating at present, and it could survive the high-pressure water jets and deeper immersion, enabling the device to last longer." This rating is particularly suitable for "those who use the device in rugged environments."
    

### 3\. Practical Implications and Purchasing Considerations:

*   **True Water and Dust Resistance:** "The smartphone with IP68 or IP69 ratings is considered to be truly water-resistant and dustproof."
    
*   **Recommendation for General Use:** "Overall, if you are willing to get a handset that can handle water spills, rain or even a dip in the pool, you must look for a device with at least an IP68 rating."
    
*   **Availability:** While historically high IP ratings were exclusive to premium devices like "iPhone 15, Samsung Galaxy S24," the market has evolved. Now, "brands like Redmi, Realme, Motorola, and iQOO offer IP67 and IP68 ratings in phones under Rs 20,000."
    
*   **Consumer Advice:** Consumers are advised to "Always check the rating before buying if water resistance is important to you."
    

In summary, understanding IP ratings empowers consumers to make informed decisions about smartphone durability, ensuring their chosen device can withstand common environmental challenges like dust and water exposure.
