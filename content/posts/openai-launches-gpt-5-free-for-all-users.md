**BREAKING:** OpenAI has officially launched its next-generation flagship model, **GPT-5**, making it available to all users starting today, August 7, 2025. The release marks a pivotal moment in the [AI landscape](/posts/what-is-ai/), introducing a unified, multimodal system with what OpenAI describes as "PhD-level expert" reasoning capabilities.

## What's New in GPT-5?

GPT-5 isn't just an upgrade; it's a complete architectural overhaul. The new model automatically selects the best-suited system for any given prompt, eliminating the need for users to switch between different models for text, images, or code.

### Tiered Access for Everyone

For the first time, OpenAI is making its flagship model available to free users, with different tiers of access:

-   **Free Users:** Get access to GPT-5 with usage limits. Once the limit is reached, they are switched to the highly capable GPT-5-mini.
-   **Plus Subscribers:** Receive higher usage limits for GPT-5.
-   **Pro & Team Subscribers:** Enjoy unlimited access to GPT-5 and exclusive access to the even more powerful **GPT-5 Pro**, designed for enterprise-level tasks.

### A Major Leap for Developers

This release is a game-changer for the developer community. Key improvements include:

-   **Enhanced Coding & Debugging:** GPT-5 has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on coding benchmarks, showing a remarkable ability to handle complex code generation and debugging tasks.
-   **GitHub Copilot Integration:** The new model is already in public preview in GitHub Copilot for all paid plans, promising to enhance code quality and enable more sophisticated, agent-like capabilities.
-   **Expanded Context & Control:** Developers now have access to a **256K token context window**, free-form function calling, and greater control over the model's verbosity.

## Redefining the AI Race

The launch of GPT-5 solidifies OpenAI's position as a leader in the field and is set to accelerate the AI race among tech giants. With its advanced reasoning, improved factual accuracy, and new "Safe Completions" feature to prevent misuse, GPT-5 is designed to be both more powerful and more reliable.

## Expert Reaction

> "The launch of GPT-5 is the paradigm shift we were anticipating. By unifying modalities and making this level of reasoning accessible to everyone, OpenAI is not just releasing a product; they are setting a new baseline for the entire industry. The implications for science, development, and creative work are staggering."
