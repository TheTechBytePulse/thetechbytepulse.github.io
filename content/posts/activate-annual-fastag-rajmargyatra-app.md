In a move to streamline toll payments, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) now allows travelers to activate and manage an Annual FASTag Pass directly through its ‘Rajmargyatra’ mobile app. This new feature, integrated into the comprehensive highway user portal, offers a cost-effective solution for frequent commuters. For a fixed annual fee of ₹3000, the pass allows for up to 200 trips through any toll plaza on national highways, with each entry counted as a single trip.

### Annual Pass vs. Regular Toll: A Cost Comparison

With the annual pass, each trip through a toll plaza costs a flat rate of ₹15 (₹3000 / 200 trips). Let's see how this compares to the standard toll fees on the Bangalore to Tirupati route:

| Toll Plaza          | Regular Toll (₹) | Annual Pass Cost (₹) | Savings (₹) |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- | ----------- |
| Hoskote             | 25               | 15                   | 10          |
| Mulbagal            | 90               | 15                   | 75          |
| Nangli              | 35               | 15                   | 20          |
| Mahasamudram        | 100              | 15                   | 85          |
| Gadanki             | 125              | 15                   | 110         |
| **Total (One-Way)** | **375**          | **75**               | **300**     |

As you can see, the annual pass offers significant savings at each toll plaza. A one-way trip from Bangalore to Tirupati would cost only ₹75 with the annual pass, compared to ₹375 at the regular price, saving you ₹300 on a single trip.
